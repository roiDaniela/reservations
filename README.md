# reservations

<b>INDIVIDUAL EXERCISE 1</b>
<br/>
It so happens that our restaurant has a bunch of open tables. Therefore, if someone doesn't have a reservation, add it to the reservations object and set "claimed" to true for that person. Alert them of their new reservation.
<br/><br/>

<b>INDIVIDUAL EXERCISE 2</b>
<br/>
As of now, 'Ted' and 'ted' are two different names in our system. Change your code so that 'ted' and 'Ted' or even 'TeD' is all the same. Use Google and Stack Overflow to help with this.
<br/><br/>

<b>INDIVIDUAL EXERCISE EXTENSION 1</b>
<br/>
Until now we've been using prompt and alert. Instead, add an input field and button in HTML.

<b>INDIVIDUAL EXERCISE EXTENSION 2</b>
<br/>
Add the reservations to the HTML as they're made.
